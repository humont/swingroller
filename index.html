<p>According to Psychologist Jean Epstein, kids don’t play to learn. They learn because they pay. That is the reason why Kindergarten have a full range of educational toys like ride on toys, toys to learn the letters or the numbers, creative or manual toys, each of them dedicated to improve your kids development: intellectual, physical and social functions. The swingroller is originally an educational toy for Kindergartens. 
    </p>
<p>The child by playing with I, will learn gross motor skills, muscle coordination and also, if in a team game, socializing with other children.

<div class="pt4 pb5 mh6_l">
<p>There are no batteries, no motors, no pedals and no chains so it’s very easy and safe to use because child himself control his speed and motion. 
    </p> 
<p>As with all products classified as wheel toys, the swingroller is to be used only on flat hard surfaces away from public roads, and under supervision of an adult.

  Our Innovation
</div>
<hr>
<div class="pt4 pb5 mh6_l">
<p>Erick Nicolle is an eternal teenager. He is bubbling with ideas and has a knack of making inert materials become wonderful toys! No wonder some of his friends call him Geppetto! 
  </p>
<p>Back in 1999, he somehow came to the idea of changing the concept of traditional kart and apply the action reaction concept to a 3 wheel's kart and he came out with THE SWINGROLLER, an ultra-innovative ride-on.
  </p>
<p>Imagine : Any kid could sit on it and learn instantly how to go around the playground in a fully autonomous way to have fun!
</p>
<p>Your child just pushes alternatively with his feet, and the Swingroller starts going foward in a snakelike motion. 
  </p>
<p>Hum well,  we have to be honest with you... there is one issue... once the kids try it, they won't let go!!
